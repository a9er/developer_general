# Root cause analysis  
### Basics
Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is a process used to determine the underlying or root cause of a problem.
It's purpose is to not only identify *what* and *how* an event occurred, but also to determine *why* it occurred.
Two of the common techniques use in RCA are the 5 Whys and the Fishbone Diagram

### 5 Whys
The 5 Whys is a technique used expose the layers of cause and effect that are present in a problem.
The technique in it's simplest form looks like this:
1. Write down the specific problem
2. Ask why the problem occurs and write down the answer
3. If the answer does not identify the root cause of the problem from step 1, ask why again.
4. Continue to loop over step 3 until the root cause is found

It is important to note that the 5 time iteration is a guide and that your analysis may take fewer/more steps to identify the root cause.

### Fishbone Diagram
The Fishbone diagram (also known as as the cause and effect or Ishikawa diagram) is used to explore the potential causes of a problem and is a visual way to look at cause and effect.
The specific problem is written at the head of the fish, with the possible causes categorised and added to the diagram as "bones".

The technique in it's simplest form looks like this:
1. Write down the specific problem at the head
2. Determine the major categories of causes of the problem and add theses as branches from the backbone
3. Determine the possible causes of the problem and add these as bones from the corresponding category branches
4. Examine why each cause happens and add sub-causes that branch off each cause branch
5. Continue to add sub-causes as required
