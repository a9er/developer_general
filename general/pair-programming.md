# Pair programming

Pair programming orginates from Extreme programming (XP). Two people working together at the same computer to achieve a common goal​. Pair programming is one of the best ways to learn from other developers and is encouraged at lots of companies.

## How to best learn
Practice, pair with as many people as possible.

[Code Retreats](http://coderetreat.org/) are a great way to get experience pairing. Find a CodeRetreat group in your area and attend an event.

## Principles
- No insults
- Be respectful
- Nobody likes a bossy driver
- Communication is key
- Switch roles driver/navigator often
- Be mindful of personal space

## Styles

### Ping Pong

* One person writes a failing test​
* Other person makes it pass​
* Swap roles​

### Driver / Navigator​

#### Driver

* Concentrates on typing, entering syntax correctly, navigating around IDE etc​
* Focused on single task ​

#### Navigator

* Thinking of the numerous tasks involved​
* Thinking of "bigger picture”​
* Keeps track of tasks as they arise​

#### Swap Roles​

* Up to pair when this happens​
* For example, when one person becomes stuck or tires​

## Benefit

* Immediate feedback​
* Motivating for the pair​
* Its intense, can be exhausting when starting out​
