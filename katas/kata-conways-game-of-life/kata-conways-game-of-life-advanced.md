# Conway's Game of Life Kata Advanced

There are a number of possible customizations to advanced Conways GoL. Once you have completed the [Basic Conways GoL](kata-conways-game-of-life.md) do one or more of the following:

----

### More User Friendly Conways

Allows a more user friendly version of Conways

* Allow world state to be saved and loaded from disk  
* Allow users to customize the world state on startup  

----

### Support two user interfaces 

If the initial Conways had only one user interface (i.e., command line), write a version of Conways that supports two interfaces (i.e., command line and web application).  

Make sure that one interface is event-driven (i.e., web) and another is loop-driven (i.e., command line).   

This becomes the perfect opportunity to teach about abstraction of a view layer and "Tell Don't Ask."  

----

### 3D Conways

At the beginning of a game you should be able to determine whether you want to work in a 3D or 2D world. The rules remain the same except in a 3D world you can have neighbors on either side.
