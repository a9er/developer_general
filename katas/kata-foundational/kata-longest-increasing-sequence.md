# Longest increasing sequence kata

> Given an integer array, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

## Examples

- Input: arr[] = [3, 10, 2, 1, 20]<br>
Output: Length of increasing subsequence  = 3<br>
Explanation : The longest increasing subsequence is [3, 10, 20]
- Input: arr[] = [3, 2]<br>
Output: Length of increasing subsequence  = 1<br>
Explanation : The longest increasing subsequence are [3] and [2]
