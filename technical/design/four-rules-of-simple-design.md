# Four rules of simple design  

Kent Beck originally described the *four rules of simple design* as design guidance when applying [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming) in the late 1990's.

The rules are worthy of constant consideration as they remain just as relevant today, provide a succinct guide to software design and transcend programming paradigms.

### The rules

- **Passes the tests**: Is functionally correct, verified through comprehensive automated tests.
- **Reveals intention**: From the readers perspective the implementation is clear and unambiguous.
- **No duplication**: Is a [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) implementation, with no duplicated logic.
- **Fewest elements**: If the above 3 rules are met, any other elements of the design are superfluous and candidates for simplification.
