# Containerization

Containerization involves bundling an application together with all of its related configuration files, libraries and dependencies required for it to run across different computing environments. Similar to the Java ideal of "write once, run anywhere", containerization promises that what you build will run the same way on any environment.

One of the most popular containerization is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and is the preferred industry containerization technology currently.

To help you understand what containerization is and how it can help with developing and deploying applications we've found some material which is worth spending some time with.

* Scott Scott Hanselman's video [Containers? So What? Docker 101 Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oEsMwSxBsk) is an easy to follow introduction to Docker.
* The [DevOps Girls Docker 101 Workshop](https://github.com/DevOps-Girls/docker-101) is a great workshop taking you through the basic Docker tasks with explanations of what you are doing and why along the way.
* The [Docker 101 Tutorial](https://www.docker.com/101-tutorial) is a hands-on tutorial taking you though almost everything you will ever do with Docker. It has some more advanced techniques.
