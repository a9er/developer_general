# TDD - Test driven development

Kent Beck is credited with having developed the concept of TDD. Test driven development is related to the test-first programming concepts of extreme programming.

The TDD development cycle
- Write a failing test (red)
- Write production code to make the test pass (green)
- Refactor
- Repeat

### What is TDD?
- An approach to iteratively decompose a large problem into smaller problems​.
- Facilitates working in small increments​.
- Provides focus (just concentrate on the next step to take)​.
- Provides feedback on design at each step​.
- Makes it easier for others to understand behaviour of system​.

### Principles
- Test first
- Fail fast
- Don't forget to refactor (adhere to [4 principles of simple design](../design/four-rules-of-simple-design.md))
- Short cycles of a few minutes

### Three laws of TDD
1. You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
2. You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
3. You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## Practice Katas

- [String Calculator Kata](../../katas/kata-string-calculator.md)  

The string calculator kata is a beginner kata to start learning how to write unit tests first. Admittedly it is not teaching you TDD but rather introducing you to a component of TDD, writing the test first.
