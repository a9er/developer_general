# Naming things

### The Basics
In any written or verbal language, appropriate word use is key to great communication. The same holds true when programming.

Written code has two audiences - the *computer* and the *human*.  From the computers point of view, it reads the code with a view to translating it to underlying instructions.
From a human point of view, we read the code to derive meaning - what does the code do and why?
To satisfy these two audiences the code must be *functionally correct* and *convey intent*.
Often when programming we have a clear understanding of *what we want the computer to do* - that is considered the *easier part* of the communication.
The *harder part* of the communication is to the reader, in choosing your words carefully and deliberately, in *naming the things*.
Indeed a software developer can think of themselves as *an author*, revealing what problems the software solves, the design of the solution and the details of the solution all in one document.

In-line with [domain driven design](../design/ddd.md) thinking, better names leverage terms that are:
- From the domain of the problem (the *problem space*), as opposed to terms from the technical implementation (the *solution space*)
- Part of a *ubiquitous language*, known across an organisation and not just developers 

For example, names following accounting concepts will better convey meaning, intent and communicate to a broader audience than names following design pattern names or roles in a layered architecture - these are useful but less important.

When you consider that the [costs of software maintenance far outweigh creation costs](http://www.agilemodeling.com/essays/costOfChange.htm), the quality of your communication has economic consequences.
Your software will be read many times in its lifetime. The accuracy with which it is interpreted and the time it takes to do so is an important part of lowering that cost.

So your *names*, or put most generally your *language used*, is critical.

The skill of effective naming is a fundamental programming skill, applicable to any paradigm or programming language and to any code you write - be it source, test or operational.
Bear in mind that investing time in it will strengthen your general communication skills - a life skill useful in any setting.

So, invest that time.  Engage others for advice, particularly analysts and domain experts.  Have a team discussion to ensure alignment.
The time you take to make deliberate naming choices is time well spent.
