# Unix Command Line

## The Basics

[The Command Line Interface](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html) is the primary method of interacting with a Unix OS - even as graphical interfaces exist. Through your career, you will need to navigate modify, and create directory.

[File manipulation](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html) is also a critical bit. Know how to copy, move, or remove files.

[Unix](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html) is composed of several object primitives which make up an operating system. Understand what a file, directory, and process is in the world of Unix.

## Checkpoint: Exercise 1

Try to make a directory using your Mac terminal, and create a structure for where you will put the code that you're working on.

## Advanced

[Redirection and pipes](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix3.html) are Unix's way of 'forwarding' traffic that usually goes to the standard output.  One of the great things about using pipes to redirect one program's output _(stdout)_ into a second program's input _(stdin)_ is that it allows both programs to run simultaneously and permits data to be transferred between them continuously rather than having to pass it through temporary text files or through the display screen and having to wait for one program to be completed before the next program begins.

[Understanding Linux users and groups](https://linuxacademy.com/howtoguides/posts/show/topic/12659-understanding-linux-users-and-groups) is an important part of understanding the security model in Linux and how you can secure or share resources.

[Permissions and access writes](http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix5.html) make sure that your files are only accessible by you and no one else. In the world of cloud computing where resources are shared, this becomes even more critical as is a good understanding of the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-principle-least-privilege-polp-best-practice-information-security-and-compliance).

[Bash scripting](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO.html) enables you to easily write your own command line tools that you can execute at a later time.  This promotes consistency and automation and means that you'll make less mistakes.

## Checkpoint: Exercise 2

Show the permissions of your current Documents and Desktop directories using `ls -la`

## Checkpoint: Exercise 3

Create a Virtual Machine on your computer and install [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com) Desktop into that VM.  This will give you a safe place to play around with the knowledge that you won't break anything.

## Checkpoint: Exercise 4

Use SSH to connect to a remote server using an SSH key for authentication.
