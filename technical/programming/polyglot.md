## Using CodeWars to learn a programming language

One of the best ways to learn a language is to practice it daily; CodeWars is a site that provides kata's (or problems to solve)  in various programming languages. 

Once you have completed a kata you can see how others have done it, giving you insights into alternative ways of solving programming problems..

If you do not have a CodeWars account yet [sign up here](https://www.codewars.com/join).

The Pearl Promise is... "if you do at least one [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com) Level 8 or Level 7 kyu kata a day for at least 4 weeks, reviewing what other people have submitted, you will become fluent in that language in no time".
