# Refactoring 

Refactoring is the process of looking at your existing code and restructuring it to allow better readability, maintainability, performance and a more expressive architecture of your code. It is important to keep in mind that refactoring should not change the external behaviour of your code. 

Refactoring is a very broad term and can range from renaming a variable to restructuring the entire solution. We can easily get into a refactoring mode and forget about the time we spend doing it. Though this act of continually refactoring is a good habit we need to be cognisant of the extent to which we refactor and in what context we are doing it.

When done properly refactoring does help fight the entropy which tends to build up in software systems. This allows us to always have a good healthy code base which doesn't impede our ability to add features and extend the capability of the system.

### Refactoring Workflows

- TDD Refactoring
- Litter-Pickup Refactoring (Boyscout Rule)
- Comprehension Refactoring
- Preparatory Refactoring
- Planned Refactoring 

### Principles

- A contious improvement mind set.
- Best done safely when there are test covering the code being refactored.
- Small steps, every change should be broken down into the smallest piece.
- Teams should have a shared understanding of where they would like to be in terms of design of the sysytem.
