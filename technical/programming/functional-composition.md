# Foundational programming concepts

When starting out with programming it can seem like a vast field with many different things to learn. It helps to first learn the foundational concepts and then build up from them. A strongly typed object oriented language is a great first paradigm to deepen your understanding of programming language concepts. Two languages to consider: Java or C# 

Below we have identified some basic concepts to focus on ordered by priority to learn:

## C# &amp; Java

* Variables & Types
* If / Else & Case Statements
* Methods & Functions
* Arrays
* Collections (List, Dictionary/HashSet)
* Looping
* Enums
* Classes
	* Public/Private Methods
	* Static methods vs instance methods
	* Constructor & passing values through a constructor
	* Private Variables

* Inheritance with classes (and why it should usually be avoided)
* Composition with classes (why this is usually better than inheritance)  
* Interfaces
* Exceptions
