# Object Composition

> The problem with object-oriented languages is theyâ€™ve got all this implicit environment that they carry around with them. You wanted a banana but what you got was a gorilla holding the banana and the entire jungle.

Object composition can (and should!) be used to avoid the problem alluded to in the quote above. When we wish to share functionality between multiple classes, instead of creating a single parent class we can

1. Create one or more smaller classes or interfaces that encapsulate the desired functionality (and adhere to the [single responsibility principle](../design/solid.md)!)
1. Include instances of these in the any new classes we wish to share functionality with
1. Expose the desired functionality by using these instances
